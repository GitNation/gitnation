## About GitNation

[GitNation](https://gitnation.org/#about) is a foundation contributing to the development of the technological landscape by organizing events which focus on the open source software. We organize meaningful and entertaining JavaScript conferences and meetups, connecting talented engineers, researchers, and core teams of important libraries and technologies.

We support open-source projects by highlighting them and their authors at the annual Open Source Awards ceremony initiated by GitNation.

We are a foundation that celebrates diversity. Thatâ€™s why for every conference, we provide scholarships for attendees from underrepresented groups, and we run mentorship programs to help people get on stage as speakers regardless of their gender, identity, ethnicity, ability or other criteria.

GitNation was founded by OSS enthusiasts, engineers, and community activists, and it has been run by them to this day.

Besides offering [single conference tickets](https://gitnation.org/#events), the organization also sells a GitNation Multipass providing discounted access to multiple [remote JavaScript conferences and workshops](https://portal.gitnation.org/multipass).
